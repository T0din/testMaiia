1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.15.1 and npm v5 or above installed.
2.  Clone this repo
3.  Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._

## Notes

This test uses a boilerplate to speed up the set up. A lot of code is not used and hasn't been cleaned.
I decided to use inline style as opposed to the CSS used in the boilerplate to differentiate what i coded to what was already there.
The UI could be improved.
The code could be refactored, with smaller components, separate UI from logic.
The cart should be transpages instead of being on the photos page only.
It's worth noting that i have almost never used Redux before this test.
